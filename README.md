# IoTCity



The web application was made with Django framework in Python. The main goal of the software is to develop a management, monitoring and actuation platform over the city data in real-time. It stores the values ​​received from various sensors of several types in a city (temperature, waste containers, visible radiation, infrared, Co2, ...) and shows the to the city manager. Besides that, it allows to define alarms according to the values ​​received form the sensors, and act in actuators (e.g. turn on the city lights) when alarms are triggered.
