						<p>&emsp;This was the last week of the project in this course.</p>

						<p>&emsp;During the week, we had a meeting with our mentors about the feedback received, Students@Deti logistics and last features that we could implement.</p>

						<p>&emsp;In the weekend we implemented a new mobile application for the city manager. It was a big race against time but we did it. The main feature is that it notifies the city manager about triggered alerts with push nofitications and with a dedicated view to the triggered alerts (and their relevant information). On the citzien IoT City mobile app, the localization buttons on the detailed metrics view are fully working, and we also added an option in the filtering metrics menu on the dashboard: now we have an option to make all metrics visible at once. The notifications were also implemented in the web portal and we also solved some final usability issues of the web portal.</p>

						<p>&emsp;The week ended with the Students@Deti where we made our presentation and demonstration to teachers, students and other people from outside the academic community. It was a great day and we received very positive feedbakck.</p>

						<p>&emsp;During the week, the poster for Students@Deti was made and some changes were made on the web and admin portal (like adding the name of metrics on cards, or solving minor bugs on the interface).</p>

						<p>&emsp;We also did some changes on the mobile app. We started by changing the "Filter metrics" menu on the dashboard. We added localization buttons to the tables per row, in each detailed view of the metrics. The purpose is, when clicking on the buttons, the user will be redirected to the map view, where the respective sensor icon will appear with his popup open. We also fixed some other minor bugs.</p>

						<p>&emsp;Finally, we also updated part of the website for the final documentation.</p>

						<p>&emsp;Due to some issues with the IT VM where the system was deployed, we migrated the web server to an external virtual machine, with the new ip being http://178.62.255.129/.</p>
						
						<p>&emsp;We finalized the implementation of all features on the mobile app, which means that the app can now send user reports (with photos/videos); the app has a tutorial on the Help screen to help users navigate in the application; and the app has swipe refresh. </p>

						<p>&emsp;The luminary sensor is also working, and we can send commands to change the dimming percentage of the luminary from the web portal.</p>

						<p>&emsp;On Monday we had a meeting at Altice Labs to discuss the web portal, admin portal and mobile app. We also talked about new ideas for all of these platforms and established some points of future work on them. On the next day was the final preparation for the M5 demo and presentation.</p>

						<p>&emsp;On this week we broke our weekly hour record! The lighting sensor is now on our hands and it is integrated with the platform. We have made an API with the ability to receive instruction from the web portal to change the percentage of dimming.</p>

						<p>&emsp;On the web portal, we separated the rules and alerts pages, and all the tables related to them. We also added a chart indicating the number of user reports per sensor. The interface was partially redesigned according to the feedback of Altice usability team.</p>

						<p>&emsp;On the 10th of April, we had our weekly reunion only with our collaborators. We discussed some aspects about our web portal interface such as the dashboard view, opting by a user interface based on profiles. Also, we discussed the integration of the Drones in the IoT platform.</p>

						<p>&emsp;During this week, we had a meeting at Altice Labs about usability issues of our web portal. Due to this, the alerts page was divided: one page will contain the active and triggered alerts and the other page will contain the rules defined by the user. The user reports, sensors details page and dashboard were also changed.</p>

						<p>&emsp;On the mobile application, the map now shows the location of the sensors dynamically, and values of some subscriptions as well. Checkboxes were added to this screen to filter the desired sensors we want to make visible on the map. Also, on the map screen, we added a feature that allows the user to write locations and find them on the map. The layout of the mobile app was improved. We now have the view to retrieve values from the sensors to the mobile app sensors details screen. Some bugs on the app were fixed.</p>

						<p>&emsp;During the week, we worked on the web portal, mobile application, website documentation and M4 presentation.</p>
						
						<p>&emsp;On the web portal, we added a switch to change the state of sensor in the details sensors page, popups to details of active and triggered alerts and a mailbox in the reports page. Some bugs were also solved.</p>
						
						<p>&emsp;On the mobile application, several features were added. The app now has GPS feature enabled which allows it to display the user location on the map and to get the nearest sensors to the user location. On the map view, the sensors icons were added, as well as a view for each icon were we can display all the information regarding each sensor. Video capture and access to gallery features were added to the reports view. The dashboard is fully dynamic now, and displays the sensors values. The views for each metric were improved: now there are buttons to select the start date and end date on the graph, and the table to display the values has more information and functionalities - for example a button to display or not a sensor data in the graph.</p>
						
						<p>&emsp;On the website, we added technician use cases, user scenarios and sequence diagrams. We also changed the information about how to deploy the system and the technical requirements.</p>
						
						<p>&emsp;On the 2nd of May, two team members had a meeting with our mentor to discuss the architecture and technical details. We also had a team meeting to discuss and finalize the M4 presentation.</p>

						<p>&emsp;During the week, for the delivery of Milestone 3, we change several aspects from our website: the page "Developer Area" was concluded with the deployment configurations, FAQ and "Future Work" sections. The experience maps, use cases and functional tests were also enhanced.</p>

						<p>&emsp;On the web portal, we added actuators to alerts and we are half way through the user reports and alerts pages.</p>

						<p>&emsp;On the mobile application, the dashboard tiles were changed and some metrics already have dynamic values. The connection with the server was made with a REST API.</p>

						<p>&emsp;The deployment was concluded, after a lot of issues with some components. Celery had major memory leaks, so it was needed higher RAM memory and higher number of CPU's in the virtual machine. The production database was also deployed, and the sensors and streams were manually added to the production environment. We are finally ready to gather values from real sensors on an extended period of time.</p>

						<p>&emsp;During the week, the interface to communicate between the server and SmartIoT was finished. The temperature (that also gives pressure) and waste management sensors were also successfully programmed to communicate with SmartIoT. It was created an initial database for storing the data coming from SmartIoT. The database was created in sqlite3, but it is ready for a migration to postgresql when in production. With asynchronous tasks, the server will receive the data from SmartIoT and save it on a database. With the data saved, we can then display it on the web portal and analyse it.</p>

						<p>&emsp;On the web portal, it was added a map with the location and metrics received from the sensors, and also some cards showing the last metrics saved on the database. Some ideas were exchanged in order to integrate the metrics gathered and the interaction with the actuators and alerts defined by the user.</p>

It was suggested the division of work by the project verticals (temperature sensor, waste management sensor, ...). We decided the division of tasks would be done on a horizontal way, with two elements working on the sensors, two elements working on the IoT Platform (server and broker) and other two elements working on the web portal. We also took possession of the first sensors.</p>

We also discussed some aspects of the architecture model after feedback of Altice Labs collaborator Filipe Cabral Pinto.</p>
						
						<p>&emsp;During the week, each team divided by its tasks made some important things:</p>
						<p>&emsp;- The team working on sensors (José and Miguel) worked in gathering temperature and barometric sensors' information and send it to the broker.</p>
						<p>&emsp;- The team working on the IoT Platform (Ana and Diogo) developed a local broker, using Django, RabbitMQ and Celery, for local testing. They also began to implement a web server using Django Framework to deploy the web portal, and simultaneously with periodic asynchronous requests to the broker (using RabbitMQ and Celery). Finally, they started to create two python interfaces for communicating with both brokers (local broker and SmartIoT).</p>
						<p>&emsp;- The team working on the web Portal (Inês and Luís) started by exploring existent templates for dashboard web sites. When the template was chosen, both started adjusting the template for the project purpose.</p>

The sensors that the team members discussed and proposed were sound, people counter and UV radiation sensors. The mentor and collaborators will try to gather at least one sensor of each type for the platform.</p>
						
						<p>&emsp;On the 24th of February, four team members had a meeting with the mentor to discuss the architecture of the solution. Prof. Ilídio suggested a three-layered service application (Presentation Layer, Business Layer and Data Layer). It was also settled that the main interface with the user would be a web portal designed for a city manager who can watch and act according to the information displayed. For the regular user, would be designed a mobile application with information gathering from the sensors, without any actuator.</p>

						<p>&emsp;During the week, all team members worked on Milestone 1. The team defined that the mobile app would only be functional in a later milestone, giving main priority to the web portal. The team also agreed that if the sensors needed would not be available, we would use simulators.</p>

						<p>&emsp;We had our first meeting with our mentor Prof. Ilídio and collaborator Prof. Susana in the 17th of February (Friday). The aim of the meeting was to describe the project context and to understand how Altice Labs would be supporting us. We agreed that main goal of the project is to develop a dashboard of a city using mainly the Altice Labs sensors, with their platform SmartIoT.
						
						We also discussed about the sensors that could be used, and it was asked to write possible use cases for the next meeting, where the Altice Labs Collaborator (Eng. Filipe Cabral Pinto) will be present and we can reach upon an agreement in terms of architecture.</p>

						<p>&emsp;During the week, the logotype and the project website were created, and a first version of the architecture diagram was made.</p>

						<p>&emsp;In the 21st of February (Thursday), the team members decided to make an internal meeting, to discuss some fundamental points for the first mileston delivery, such as use cases and architecture of the project, as well as to describe the sensors that we would like to have. It was also approached the interest in performing usability tests on the web portal interface. Finally, it was discussed the scope for the next day meeting with the mentor and collaborators.</p>
